<h2>What is "Restroom Mapper"?</h2>
<p>Restroom Mapper is a restroom locator and reviewing platform for restrooms across the world! It helps people find the right restrooms for them based on reviews, restroom flags and warnings.</p>

<h2>Do I need an account?</h2>
<p>You do not need an account to access the Restroom Mapper site and browse the restroom listings. If you would like to add and review restrooms you must create an account.
It’s easy and anonymous. Create an account by clicking the "Create An Account" button in the upper right of the navigation bar.</p>

<h2>How do I add a restroom?</h2>
<p class='icon-key'> To add a restroom, click on the add restroom button on the navigation bar. Once on the add restroom page, you can assign a name, location, and description. You can use the provided Restroom Map to drop a pin on the exact restroom location.</p>

<h2>How do I find a nearby restroom?</h2>
<p>There are several ways to find a nearby restroom. You can do this most easily by clicking on the “Nearby” button on the navigation bar. This page will list all restrooms close to you based on available GPS information. Remember, if your GPS is turned off, it will be much more inaccurate.</p>

<h2>How do I rate a restroom?</h2>
<p class='icon-key'> First navigate to the restroom you wish to rate. Below the map, press a large button labeled "Review This Bathroom". Once pressed a new area will show itself. Click on the number of stars that you think the restroom deserves and provide a description of your experience in the field below that.</p>

<h2>What are restroom flags and how do I use them?</h2>
<p class='icon-key'> Restroom flags are used to identify restrooms for consistent characteristics, positive or negative. For example, if a restroom is consistently out of toilet paper, users can flag it to warn other users. On the other hand, users could flag it for outstanding cleanliness.
You can add these flags on the restroom page the same way you add ratings.</p>
